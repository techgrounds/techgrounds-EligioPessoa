# AWS Trusted Advisor

AWS Trusted Advisor is a service that inspects all the resources present in your AWS account and suggests improvements to bring them in line with AWS best practices.

When you first start using AWS it is reasonably easy to keep track of what you have running, however as time goes on and your account footprint grows you may start to get sub-optimal scenarios in terms of cost management and performance that go unnoticed.

You may have orphaned resources, unused or obsolete snapshots, storage volumes that are no longer in use, resources that are not attached to instances, the list goes on and these resources are costing your business money. You may also have resources configured that aren’t optimised for security, performance or fault tolerance. 

In simple terms, AWS Trusted Advisor is a native AWS tool that provides active guidance to operate AWS workloads consistently, safely, and efficiently. 

AWS Trusted Advisor acts as a consultant with deep knowledge of AWS who can diagnose problems within your AWS infrastructure to improve performance, reliability, security, and costs. AWS Trusted Advisor evaluates your AWS resources by using pre-defined monitoring rules called “Checks.”

Trusted Advisor checks five categories of best practice compliance being cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance and service limits.

Not all Checks are available to every account. AWS has set up a pricing plan to offer more Checks to customers subscribing to a higher support plan.
