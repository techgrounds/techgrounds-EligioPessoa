# Variables

Variables in Python are like containers that hold values, such as numbers, text, or other data. They allow you to store and manipulate data in your programs, making it easier to refer to and work with specific information. By assigning values to variables, you can store and retrieve data throughout your code, enabling you to perform calculations, make decisions, and create dynamic programs.
